oom_notifierd is an out-of-memory notification tool for users.  It is meant to be run from /etc/ssh/sshrc.  Each instance will look up the memory cgroup that it is a member of then will monitor it for OOM events.  When one occurs, it is notified by the kernel and will then write to the user's tty (or non-tty as applicable).  It only uses a few hundred bytes of RAM so it shouldn't be a burden to have one per ssh connection.

It should be launched inside of the target memory cgroup or have the target's path specified as the only argument to the program.

oom_notifierd is released under the MIT license (see the top of oom_notifierd for a copy of the license).  Some GPLv2+ code is also incorporated to set the process' cmdline (for top, ps, etc.).  This can be disabled by setting -DNO_GPL while compiling if the GPL is a concern for you.

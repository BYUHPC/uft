This PAM module creates a cgroup per user in the memory and cpu subsystems whenever the user logs in.  The cgroups are initialized each time with the values provided as arguments to the module.  root is moved to the root of the cgroup so there is no limit.  Note that you must mount the cgroups ahead of time.

libcgroup should (soon?) have this functionality through "templates".  At that time it may be advisable to switch to libcgroup, though the configuration can be a little more difficult.

Include pam_cgroup_per_user.so at the bottom of /etc/pam.d/{sshd,sudo,sudo-i,su,su-l} and any other relevant files.

Options:
	memory.limit_in_bytes		Memory usage limit in the cgroup
	memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes	Memory+swap usage limit in the cgroup
	cpu.shares			Soft limit of CPU utilization: Soft CPU limit = (#CPUs * cpu.shares/1024)
	user_cpu_dir			Path to the cpu cgroup directory you want to use (e.g. /cgroup/cpu/users)
	user_mem_dir			Path to the memory cgroup directory you want to use (e.g. /cgroup/mem/users)

Example:
	session required pam_cgroup_per_user.so memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes=17G memory.limit_in_bytes=16G cpu.shares=1024
